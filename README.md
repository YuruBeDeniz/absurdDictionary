# absurdDictionary
project 3

Absurd Dictionary is inspired by Turkish Ekşi Sözlük (https://eksisozluk.com/) which is an unofficial dictionary, more precisely, source of information.
The aim is to share and spead knowledge in collaborative way. The database is created based on user contribution. 
While it is very popular in Turkey, and many people refer to these website to learn more, I have not found anything similar in Germany. 

I started the project with creating the models and autentication. Then, I continued with pages and components. In the meantime, I created several routes for requests. 
Lastly, I gave CSS styling and deployed to heroku. 

Create topics, start discussions, write entries and enjoy freedom without showing any source or reference!!!
